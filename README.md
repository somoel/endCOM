# COM Surrogate Process Terminator

This Python script terminates COM Surrogate processes generated by an unfixed Edge Dev bug that prevents downloaded files from being deleted. It is advisable to run the script as an administrator.

## Usage
1. Download the latest release or Python code.
2. Run the executable (`COM_Surrogate_Terminator.exe`) or Python code as an administrator.
3. The script will identify and terminate any COM Surrogate processes.


## Requirements

For the executable:
- Windows 7 and later versions.

For the Python code:
- Python 3.x
- `psutil` library (you can install it using `pip install psutil`)

## How It Works

The script uses the `psutil` library to fetch all running processes and identifies those with the name "dllhost.exe" (which corresponds to COM Surrogate processes). It then attempts to kill these processes. If access is denied, it notifies the user to run the script as an administrator.

## Disclaimer

This script modifies system processes, so use it with caution. Make sure to back up your data before running it.
